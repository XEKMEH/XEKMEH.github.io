        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="wow fadeInLeft">
                <h3>1. Operation Gatekeeper</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/gateKeeperDeaths.png" alt="Operation Gatekeeper">
                <p class="content">Operation Gatekeeper, which was an immigration policy based on deterrence, through the increase of
                    security and militarization of the border through means of fences, border patrol vehicles,
                    helicopters, and increased personnel working the border. Through increasing security and
                    deterrence of undocumented immigrants at the border, the United States became a country much more
                    difficult to access from the southern border. The increase of security and militarization lead to
                    the numbers of migrant deaths to grow dramatically. As seen in the table above, the number of
                    deaths of undocumented immigrants increased by 474% between 1996 and 2000 (Cornelius, 669) which
                    shows the impact of Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line on the undocumented
                    immigrants attempting to cross the border. Through making the border more dangerous to cross
                    illegally, more deaths occur. Today, the border is still highly militarized, with very little
                    focus on search and rescue, and the increase funds to border patrol being used to increase the
                    number of personnel at the border daily (Dowd, 1).</p>

                <h3>2. Operation Hold The Line</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/htlPolice.png" alt="Operation Hold the Line">
                <p class="content px-2">Operation Hold the Line was a measure taken by border patrols upon witnessing a
                    large number of illegal immigrants crossing the border. The head of the El Paso border patrol
                    ordered a human and vehicle blockade. Unlike policies that preceded, Operation Hold the Line
                    sought to prevent illegal immigration rather than finding the trespassers and deporting them
                    after they have already crossed. The preventative action had both positive and negative impacts,
                    depending on what perspective you took on. For the U.S., this operation saw improvements in the
                    number of those attempting to cross over along the El Paso region. For those attempting to cross,
                    the journey became even more treacherous. With increased border security in this region,
                    immigrants sought out more deserted areas, which resulted in more deaths.</p>

                <h3>3. Timeline for Operations Gatekeeper and Hold the Line</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/ClintonWall.jpg" alt="Timeline for Operations">
                <p class="content">In July of 1993, Silvestre Reyes takes over command of the border in El Paso, Texas
                    (Martin 1). El Paso was a popular entry point because of its urban infrastructure and close
                    proximity to the city of Juarez, Mexico, which were factors in making it safer to cross when
                    compared to alternative routes through the desert. While responsible for the border region, Reyes
                    began planning for Operation Hold-the-Line, which will utilize a blockade over a 20 mile region of
                    the El Paso-Juarez border (Martin 1). The blockade officially took place on September 19, 1993 with
                    the deployment of 400 border patrol agents, who were tasked with patrols of the region and repairs
                    to the fences along the border (Martin 1). Blockade formally ended on October 2, 1993 after two
                    weeks of action, but border patrol still remains tight in that region. Operation Gatekeeper was
                    employed a year later along the Tijuana, San Diego border, the busiest land crossing for illegal
                    immigrants into the United States. One major difference between this Gatekeeper and Hold-the-Line is
                    that Gatekeeper was employed as a national strategy for border control, and signed into action by
                    President Clinton on October 1, 1994 (Gatekeeper 1). As for both of these operations, despite their
                    formal end, tough border patrols remained as a remnant from this era.

                <h3>4. U.S.  Immigration Law and Economic Policies Spike Illegal Immigration</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/workersMEX.png" alt="Imm Law and Econ Policies">
                <p class="content">Prior to the mid-1960s approximately a half million Mexicans, mostly temporary
                    Bracero workers, migrated legally to America each year. Visa caps did not exist and Mexicans
                    migrated relatively freely in and out of the country to meet labor needs (Massey and Pren). </p>
                <p class="content">This changed when Congress ended the Bracero program and passed the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act of 1965, which placed a cap of 20,000 visas per country, per year. After decades of
                    relatively free migration between Mexico and the U.S, the “migratory flows did not disappear but
                    simply continued without authorization or documentation” (Massey and Pren 5).</p>
                <p class="content">Around this time, guided by neoliberal ideology, powerful U.S corporations and the
                    United States government pushed for free trade zones in Panama, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the
                    Caribbean Basin (Gonzalez). Hundreds of factories, called maquiladoras, sprang up along the
                    Mexico/American border and in the Caribbean. Corporations enjoyed cheap foreign labor,  tax breaks,
                    and loose regulations. The factories employed mostly women, upsetting traditional social order and
                    contributing to high male unemployment (Gonzalez 257). The maquilas towns were poor, crowded, and
                    work conditions were harsh. While U.S. corporations reaped large profits and Americans enjoyed cheap
                    products, Latino workers saw a steady decline in their wages. Many fled to the United States to
                    escape unemployment, and to seek higher wages and a better quality of life.</p>

                <img class="p-3" src="images/usOUT.png" alt="U.S. Proxy Wars">
                <p class="content">The Cold War saw many Central American countries propelled into the throes of civil
                    war and chaos. The United States government, fearing the spread of communism, sponsored military
                    coups, assassinations, covert CIA operations, and provided weapons to dictators in El Salvador,
                    Nicaragua, Honduras, and Chili. As the region spiraled into chaos, people fled their homes for the
                    safety of the United States, the same country whose  “direct military and economic interventions”
                    (Gonzalez 129) caused or escalated the conditions they were fleeing. The United States “refused to
                    assist the thousands who streaming across the Mexican border to escape [the] terror” (Gonzalez 132)
                    leaving illegal entry one of their few options.</p>

                <h3>6. Proposition 187: Sending Out An SOS</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/proposition187.jpg" alt="Proposition 187">
                <p class="content">On November 8th 1994, 59% of California voters voted to pass Proposition 187 which
                    made undocumented immigrants ineligible for public social services, public health, and access to the
                    public school system (Cacho, 389). This was a huge contradiction on immigration because at the time,
                    the United States needed immigrant workers but decide to worsen living conditions while working in
                    the U.S. This was in answer to the Latino threat that was growing in the west coast. This forced
                    many people to live together in one little apartment as well as children frightened they would be
                    kicked out of school or turned in by their teachers. Overall, this proposition separated
                    “undocumented immigrants” from “the people of California” (Cacho, 395).</p>

                <h3>7. The Latino Threat</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/mexBorderIMG.jpg" alt="Latino Threat">
                <p class="content">The Latino Threat was the colluded work on the media throughout the later part of the
                    twentieth century . This narrative grew larger during the Bracero Program and even current today as
                    news sources deem Latinos to be taking “our” jobs. There were three main claims that explained how
                    Mexican immigrants were invading the United States. Latinos were believed to want to reconquer the
                    south west part of the United States and return it to Mexican control. They were also deemed unable
                    to learn english, a reproductive threat, unchanging and immutable, ect. To combat with this threat,
                    the U.S. government enforced laws such as Proposition 187. They also build walls, both physical and
                    human to try and slow down this “invasion”. This was another attempt by the United States to
                    overpower a minority just like they did with the “Puerto Rican Problem” (Briggs, 165). </p>
            </li>

                <h3>8. Defensive Tactics</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/tacticsCamera.png" alt="Tactics">
                <p class="content">The main tactic used in Operations Hold-the-Line was a heavily armed blockade, manned
                    by 400 agents. Border patrol agents were given military weapons and vehicles to deter immigrants
                    away from the urban areas of the border, and into the treacherous desert terrain (Martin 1). During
                    Operation Gatekeeper, border patrol agent presence in that area ballooned up to 11,000 agents by
                    2005, and highly advanced surveillance equipment was employed to more effectively seek out and
                    detain those trying to cross from Tijuana into San Diego (Gatekeeper 1). Pre Existing walls and
                    fences were heavily fortified making crossings even more difficult. The purpose of these tactics was
                    to deter illegal migrants from crossing in urban sections of the border, this would force them to
                    take dangerous routes through the desert, which was thought to discourage them from trying to cross
                    in the first place. However, this was not the case, with many migrants choosing to take the chance
                    through the desert, resulting in numerous deaths as a result of the operations.

                <h3>9. Immigrant Death Statistics</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/deathStats.png" alt="Death Statistics">
                <p class="content">Due to increased border enforcement and different tactics used in the two major
                    operations, apprehensions at the border declined in 93, but rose dramatically the following year,
                    especially in San Diego and in El Paso. This enforcement deterred the flow of unauthorized
                    immigration into more rural areas where the immigrants are met with harsh environment. Deaths due to
                    heat and cold increased 400% from 1993 to 1995, and deaths due to drowning rose by 160% from 1996 to
                    1998(Karl 23). Deaths due to environmental conditions are now the most common cause of death for
                    immigrants at the southern border. The number of motor vehicle accidents have also increased as a
                    result of change in the border patrol operations, whereas the count for auto-pedestrian accidents,
                    train accidents, suffocation, and homicides have maintained or have decreased with the reinforcement
                    . This statistics are far different than that of US residents, where mortality rate from heat
                    exposure due to weather conditions for Americans under 55 are less than one per million(Karl 34),
                    much less than the mortality rate from homicides or vehicular accidents.

                <h3>10. Changes in Border Patrol Over Time</h3>
                <img class="p-3" src="images/borderUSMEX.png" alt="Changes in Border Control">
                <p class="content">Before Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line, the borders were not
                    militarized. The ideas of Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line were to prevent and
                    intercept illegal immigration as it was occuring at the border, whereas before, immigration
                    policies focused on tracking down and deporting undocumented immigrants who were already in the
                    United States. In 1904, the US-Mexican border first began to be patrolled, by 75 officers on
                    horseback (Meyers, 1). By 1930, due to the Immigration Act of 1924 and the increased concern
                    during World War II, immigration officers totaled up to be about 900. During the 1930’s, due to
                    the Great Depression, the need for border patrol decreased. From the years 1942 to about 1965,
                    most migration into the United States occurred through the Mexican Bracero program. By the 1970’s
                    there was a new found need for immigration patrol, because of the quotas being reached. By 1977,
                    Congress funded the entrance of 2,580 new Border Patrol staff (Meyers, 1) which doubled by 1987.
                    More money was being funneled into Border Patrol programs, at the request of the Immigration
                    Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). More than 57% of the finances of IRCA went into the Border
                    Patrol at the Southern border, with the money being spent on helicopters, night vision goggles,
                    and surveillance equipment (Meyers, 1). The Immigration Act of 1990 led to another increase of
                    Border Patrol Agents, and the construction of a 10 foot tall steel wall along the
                    San Diego-Tijuana border (Meyers, 1). By 1992, just before Operation Hold the Line
                    (Operation Blockade), Border Patrol’s funding had reached $325 million (Meyers, 1).
                    Through “targeted enforcement” and “prevention through deterrence,” the policies of Border
                    Patrol shifted to confront the issue of undocumented immigration before the immigrants entered
                    the United States. This enforcement policy has only grown since 1993. </p>

                <h3>11. National Impacts</h3>
                <img alt="National Impacts" class="p-3" src="images/nationalImpactsIMG.png">
                <p class="content">The Immigration and naturalization services nearly tripled from 1993 to 1999, and
                    Border Patrol, under INS jurisdiction, saw 150% increase in its budget during the same period and
                    the number of agents doubled, reaching 8,200 in 1999 (Hondagneu-Sotelo 141). This in turn caused
                    more apprehension at the southern border. The success of Border Patrol resulted in aggressive pace
                    and the attitude of restrictive policies issued on immigration from 1995, to 6 policies from 1965
                    to 1995, and 8 in 1996 to 2016(Massey and Pren 12). The new policies were also announced and taken
                    with much press coverage than before. In April 2005, the Minuteman project started for civilian
                    volunteers to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border. This project also aimed to focus media attention on
                    the border issues and shape public opinion and influence immigration policies(Chavez 135). The
                    public’s anti immigration opinions formulated through these tactics are then made back into more
                    restrictive operations and policies, which increases Border Patrol’s enforcement, which further
                    increases apprehensions(Massey and Pren 13). The Militarization of Border Patrol fueled by this
                    feedback loop results in more immigrant deaths across the border and many human and civil rights
                    violations committed by law enforcement officials such as rape, extortion, physical and
                    psychological abuse, separation of families, and murder(Hondagneu-Sotelo 142).</p>

                    the border and risking their selves. The documentary we viewed in class, “Which Way Home” depicts
                    this in that even children choose to put their lives in danger and embark on the journey. Along the
                    way, many die and women are brutally raped by gang members. We can see revelations of border
                    security even today, as deportation of illegal immigrants continue all over the country. In the
                    current administration, this issue has become a target to resolve with our current president
                    proposing to build a wall on the U.S.- Mexican border.</p>
